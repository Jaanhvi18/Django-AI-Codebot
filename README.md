Django OpenAI Text Completion API

This project is the result of completing the Django OpenAI Text Completion API course on Udemy. In this course, I learned how to build web apps for Django and Python and connect them to the OpenAI Text Completion API. I also learned how to use the API to fix code and write code that I asked it to write.

Features

Ask the AI to write code for you
Choose from over a dozen programming languages
Save your code responses to the database
View past code responses from the database
I used Python, Django, and the Bootstrap Framework to build a cool coding website that connects to OpenAI. I also used a database to save all of the code answers that I received from the OpenAI API, and I queried that database and output the answers on their own web page. Finally, I connected to OpenAI with an API key, queried the engine, parsed the responses in the correct way, and outputted the answers to the homepage of my Django app.

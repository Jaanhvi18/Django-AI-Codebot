# Django OpenAI Text Completion API Project

## Project Overview
This project is the culmination of my learning from the Django OpenAI Text Completion API course by John Elder on Udemy. Throughout this course, I gained the skills to build web applications using Django and Python and integrate them seamlessly with the OpenAI Text Completion API. I honed my abilities to utilize the API for both code correction and code generation tasks, enhancing my coding proficiency.

## Features
- **Code Correction Suggestions:** Submit your code and receive AI-generated suggestions to enhance its quality.
- **AI Code Generation:** Ask the AI to write code snippets based on your prompts.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Choose from a variety of programming languages for your coding needs.
- **Database Integration:** Store code responses in a database for future reference.
- **Code History:** Access and view past code responses stored in the database.
- **Tech Stack:** Developed using Python, Django, and CSS Bootstrap Framework, providing an engaging user experience.
- **API Connectivity:** Integrated OpenAI API using an API key, processing and displaying responses on the app's homepage.

## What I Learned
- Fundamental concepts of the OpenAI Text Completion API.
- Building web applications using Django.
- Programming with Python.
- Integrating APIs into Django projects.

## Requirements
- Basic understanding of Python and Django is recommended, but no special tools are required.

This project showcases my proficiency in building web applications with Django, integrating external APIs, and leveraging AI for code-related tasks, all under the guidance of instructor John Elder.
